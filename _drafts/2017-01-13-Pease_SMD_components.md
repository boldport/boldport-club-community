# If you include summary text here, it will be used for display
# in the post listing instead of an excerpt from the post body
summary: I got the board as part of the 'Just less than perfect bundle 1' and decided to use SMD components (as practice for Touchy) instead of the through-hole ones that were part of the original kit.

I subscribed to the Boldport Club in March 2016, just in time to get the Cordwood Puzzle. The Pease kit was sold out in the store by then, so I was happy to be able to get the bare board as part of the 'Just less than perfect bundle 1'. :)

Here's the [imgur album]({{ page.source_url }}) that I made during the build and a video of it functioning:
