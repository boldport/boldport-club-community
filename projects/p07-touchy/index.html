We've designed a simple touch and scroll board based on Silicon Labs' EFM8SB1 'Sleepy Bee' microcontroller. The microcontroller comes in a QSOP24 package that has a 0.625 mm pitch (distance between the centre of each pin). This kit could be a challenge to solder, but we like challenges, and we hope that you do too! (We have a QSOP/SMD practice board to help.)
