The Monarch flashes its LEDs when its antennae touch. But it's also clever! It uses a clock source and shift register in a particular configuration in order to generate its patterns. Through it, one can lear about the basics of digital design, clocking, and randomness. It is a third in a series of electronic 'bugs', the first is The Lady and the second is The Gent.
