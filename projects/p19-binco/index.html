BINCO is an 11-bit binary counter that can be configured to count up or down. It uses tactile domes as buttons, one of which can control the counter to count slow or fast. Another resets the counter.

BINCO is powered by a 3V CR2032 and the circuit is designed for it to last a long time while not being used.
