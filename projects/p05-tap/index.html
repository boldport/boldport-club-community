At a time when powerful processors are so cheap and much of their functionality left unused in a typical application, itâ€™s delightful to look back to hobbyist electronics projects from forty years ago, and admire the optimised design and the skill of those who created them.

In the first edition of Elektor magazine in English, December 1974, appeared a lovely touch-activated circuit. We've re-created it for the enjoyment of those who may appreciate the elegance of the design today.
