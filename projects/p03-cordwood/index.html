In the 1950s and 1960s inventive engineers saved space by using the 'cordwood' assembly, where components are sandwiched in between two circuits boards. This construction became less useful with reduced component sizes, PCB manufacturing, and surface mount technology, but is still a lovely piece of history. Combining both old and new, the Cordwood Puzzle is a tribute to this construction.
