LIGEMDIO (LIGht EMitting DIOde) is a through-hole and surface-mount LED tester soldering kit. in its default setup, it can test through-hole LEDs through the top holes, and any size two-terminal SMD LED. The solder-blob jumpers can enable an input of a PWM signal and testing of common-anode RGB LEDs.
