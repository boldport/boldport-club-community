From Saar...

> I've been doodling and drawing all my life and been meaning for a long time to create a piece of art only with circuit board materials and manufacturing process. It's finally done! Enclosed is a circuit board art piece that I designed â€” you have one of 580 from a limited edition run.
>
> It's called 'Dreamer', featuring many doodling elements that dominate my notebooks since forever.
