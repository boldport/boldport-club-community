The Conehead is the next series of critter based PCBs (past ones are The Lady, The Gent, and The Monarch). It's an audio circuit that synthesises the sound of a cricket. It uses three oscillators interacting with each other to create the distinctive sound. Using a small speaker and a phototransistor, the cricket will change its chirping frequency depending on the amount of light it 'sees'.
