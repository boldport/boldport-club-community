Whiteboard is a set of circuits designed to allow you to power small circuit ideas on 170-point breadboards. It consists of four parts, a 3V coin cell plug-in module, a linear variable power supply, a plug-in SMD adaptor and a supporting coverlet. All these arrive in a little white canvas bag for storage.
