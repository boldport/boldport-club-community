At a time when powerful processors are so cheap and much of their functionality left unused in a typical application, itâ€™s delightful to look back to hobbyist electronics projects from forty years ago, and admire the optimised design and the skill of those who created them. MOSTAP is a digital version follow-up to Project #5, The TAP.
