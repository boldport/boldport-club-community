My second month of Boldport Club is #24 The Conehead. It’s a custom PCB design of a cricket and it chirps based on how much light the “eye” can see. According to video timestamps it took about an hour to assemble the kit and it was a lot of fun using the electronics components in different ways.
See my [blog](https://nick.blog/2018/04/24/boldport-club-24-the-conehead/) for more.
