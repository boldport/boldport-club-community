Could be the first #BoldportClub themed #ruby gem?;-)
StringyFi is a gem that converts MusicXML to PIC assembler for the Stringy.
See [LEAP#349 stringy/DemoBurner](https://github.com/tardate/LittleArduinoProjects/tree/master/BoldportClub/stringy/DemoBurner)
for an example of how it is used in practice.
