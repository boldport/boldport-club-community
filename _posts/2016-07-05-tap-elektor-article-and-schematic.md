The functionality of the circuit is comprehensively and beautifully explained in the original article
from [Elektor magazine](https://www.elektor.com/magazines/) in English, December 1974.
[Here is the article as a PDF]({{ page.pdf_url }}), and it's really worth reading.
[Here is the schematic]({{ page.images[0] }}) I re-created for the board.

We havenâ€™t made any changes to the circuit, and remarkably all of the same components are still available today, including the original 7400 IC!
