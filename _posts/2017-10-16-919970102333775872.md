Burning a new demo mode for the Boldport Club Stringy, with a Ruby gem for MusicXML conversion to PIC assembler.
Hopefully my notes may help anyone else who is interested in flashing new firmware for the Stringy!
[All notes, schematics and code are in the LEAP repo on GitHub](https://github.com/tardate/LittleArduinoProjects/tree/master/BoldportClub/mostap).
Here's a quick demo, Deep Purple's BURN! main riff..
