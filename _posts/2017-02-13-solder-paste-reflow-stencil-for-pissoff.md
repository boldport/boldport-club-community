A stencil is not a requirement for building PissOff. You will be able to assemble the kit as you would normally with a soldering iron.
If you prefer to use solder paste (which is another soldering technique that usually requires a stencil, solder paste, and other equipment) you are able to order the stencil from OSH Stencils. Totally optional.
[Use this link]({{ page.stencil_url }}) to add the stencil to your order
