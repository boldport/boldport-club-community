Here is some updated firmware I've written for #p07-Touchy, available on [GitHub](https://github.com/kbx81/Boldport-Touchy).
I hope everybody will try these out!
The I/O firmware should make it easy to interface Touchy with other kits & projects.
Let me know if you have any comments or suggestions!
I also made a video that I've posted on YouTube demonstrating the I/O firmware:
