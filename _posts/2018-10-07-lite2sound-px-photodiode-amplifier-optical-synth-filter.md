Here's a quick video demo of our Lite2Sound PX v1.4 kit and a Tektronix 603 X-Y storage monitor CRT.  I used a sawtooth waveform from a synthesizer as the X-input, and Lite2Sound as the Y-input.  Of course, I had to try the original "comb filter" effect!  Our Lite2Sound PX kit has more gain than Lite2Sound BC, and it has auto gain control.  -Eric
