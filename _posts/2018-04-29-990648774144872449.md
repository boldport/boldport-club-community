I like how the widlar board is so open form to build any of the 723 configurations.
But you've seen them all before, so I decided to make mine an "astable regulator" i.e. when in doubt, blink an LED!
[All notes, schematics and code are in the LEAP repo on GitHub](https://github.com/tardate/LittleArduinoProjects/tree/master/BoldportClub/widlar).
Here's a quick demo..
