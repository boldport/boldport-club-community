The Place Matrix is a project I built with P11-The Matrix. It was an interactive website that was live in April 2017,
but just recently did I finish completely documenting the project at
[https://www.joeyhagedorn.com/projects/placematrix/](https://www.joeyhagedorn.com/projects/placematrix/)
![ my first image]({{ page.images[0] }})

The basic project description is at
[https://www.joeyhagedorn.com/2017/04/13/placematrix.html](https://www.joeyhagedorn.com/2017/04/13/placematrix.html)
and the archival version of the project is online at
