Fritzing may be the comic sans of EDA tools but for the #BoldportClub Cuttle.
I made a Fritzing Part for The Cuttle, and I think it is pretty swish!
You can get the part and start using it in Fritzing diagrams.
It is available in the [LittleArduinoProjects](https://github.com/tardate/LittleArduinoProjects/tree/master/FritzingParts/TheCuttle) repo.
