I've been working on a Tetris game that features the BoldPort Club "Matrix" project.<br/><br/>
So far, it has the essential game mechanics, increasing speed with advancing levels, and scoring. Later I may add a high-score system.<br/><br/>
The controller is a 5-way switch that I salvaged from a cheap webcam, although it's rather touchy.
I want to replace it with a rotary encoder to spin the pieces, and buttons to move and drop them.
I'm also considering adding 7-segment displays to show the level and score in real time;
right now the score is only shown on the screen when it's game over.<br/><br/>
The code is not very polished, but it is <a href="https://github.com/tseary/BC-Matrix_Tetris_v1">available on Github</a>.
See the <a href="https://plus.google.com/+ThomasSeary/posts/a71TRXL1reo">G+ post about the game</a> which also includes a video.<br/><br/>
