dialing back the #BoldportClub Pease #1 to a low-frequency light-dependent blinky.
I joined the Boldport Club rather late, and missed out on the original Pease kit (now out of stock).
But I did manage to snaffle the PCB in sale of "Just Less the Perfect" boards.
My full build notes are in the [LittleArduinoProjects](https://github.com/tardate/LittleArduinoProjects/tree/master/BoldportClub/Pease) repo.

Since I was kit-less, I decided to experiment a bit. Firstly, I'm using a 20kÎ© LDR for input rather than a phototransistor. Secondly, after testing the original circuit on a breadboard, I decided to slow down the frequency.
