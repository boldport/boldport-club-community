The Boldport Club kits keep on giving.  This one has some nice functionality in how it turns light fluctuation of audible frequencies into sound.  Lots of possibilities to have fun with this.  It could be a feedback element to a synth, a part of an art installation, a data gathering tool.  So much fun!
