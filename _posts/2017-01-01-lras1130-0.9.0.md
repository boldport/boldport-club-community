I just published version 0.9.0 of the [LRAS1130 library on GitHub][LRAS1130].
The library now contains everything you need to do simple things with the AS1130 chip. There are also three examples how to use the class. One of the example is a LED test application which checks all LEDs and writes the status to the serial console.
