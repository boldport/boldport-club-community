This site is maintained by members of Boldport Club community.
It is a place where we share pictures, videos and information
about Club projects.

It supplements the official Boldport resources with a central archive of information shared by members.
We hope that it is a useful resource for:

* members starting a project build, looking to get inspired and informed by what others have done
* prospective members and anyone interested who wants to find out what the club really gets up to
* links to post on other platforms
* members to show off what we've done as a collective

The site is built with Jekyll and [hosted on GitHub in this repository]({{ site.repo_url }}).
Check it out, fork it, tweak it .. it's open for all, and we're always looking to make it better.
