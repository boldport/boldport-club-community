<p>
This site is only possible with the active involvement of the Boldport Community.
Contributions are most welcome, and we're trying to make it as easy as possible
for you to share your own material.
A good guide for what and how to write a contribution post
is provide in the <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/boldport/boldport-club-community/master/_drafts/template.md">post template.md</a>.
</p>

<p>
Here are a few ways you can add content to the site:
</p>

<h3>Tweet!</h3>
<p>
  Perhaps the easiest way of all ... just
  <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=%23BoldportClub">
    tweet with the hashtag #BoldportClub
  </a>
  and we may pick it up and categorise your tweet with a reference on the site.
</p>

<h3>Send a Pull-Request</h3>
<p>
  If you are familiar with GitHub, either ask for contributor access to the
  <a href="{{ site.repo_url }}">GitHub repository</a>
  or fork it and send a pull-request.
  You can even edit your contribution and send the pull-request
  directly from the Github web interface (no need to clone locally).
</p>

<h3>Create an "Issue"</h3>
<p>
  Create an issue on the site
  <a href="{{ site.repo_url }}/issues">GitHub repository</a>
  and a maintainer will pick it up and turn it into a post.
</p>

{% if site.slack_team %}
<h3>Share on Slack</h3>
<p>
  If you are in the Boldport Slack, share your contribution
  on the
  <a href="https://{{ site.slack_team }}.slack.com/messages/community-site/">
    <span class="fa fa-slack"></span>
    community-site
  </a>
  or
  <a href="https://{{ site.slack_team }}.slack.com/messages/to-share/">
    <span class="fa fa-slack"></span>
    to-share
  </a>
  slack channels and ask for help to add them to the site.
</p>
{% endif %}
